## What is LiteDocs?

LiteDocs is built with Tailwind CSS, MDX and Next.js, and it is designed to be easy to use and customize.

## Motivation

Documentation should be simple and fast to ship. LiteDocs focuses on an authoring-first workflow where you write MDX, optionally drop in React components, and publish a performant Next.js site without adopting a heavy framework.

- Reduce setup time — get a docs site running in minutes.
- Avoid vendor lock-in — keep everything in local files under `src/content`.
- Favor composition over configuration — customize via small React components.
- Provide sensible defaults for typography, theme, layout, and navigation.

## Philosophy

- Content first: writing should be the main loop, not configuring tooling.
- Convention over configuration: predictable file structure and defaults.
- Composable UI: small, focused components you can swap or extend.
- Performance & accessibility: ship fast pages with accessible navigation.
- Transparent internals: straightforward code that’s easy to read and modify.
