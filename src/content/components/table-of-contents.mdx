## Overview

LiteDocs includes a Table of Contents component that extracts headings from your content and renders a navigable outline.

## Usage

Add headings (`#`, `##`, `###`) in your MDX files. The TOC appears on the right side of the page and updates as you scroll.

### Example

```mdx
# Page Title

## Section A
Content...

### Subsection
More content...
```
